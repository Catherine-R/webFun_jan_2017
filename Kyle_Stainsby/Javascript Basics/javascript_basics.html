					<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
					<p id="intro_paragraph">JavaScript is a cross-platform,
						object-oriented scripting language.JavaScript is
						extremely popular for a variety of reasons.It is
						a small and lightweight language allowing maximum
						flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of
						different directions.JavaScript lives inside a host
						environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be
						connected to the objects of these environments to
						provide programmatic control over them.</p>
					<ul id= "ulc">
						<li><span class="underline">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are container
						for storing data values - imagine a cup fill
						with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
						All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
						these unique names are called identifiers</li>
						<li><span class="underline">Variable Assignment</span>
							Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript
							variables - our cup can now hace coffee poured into
							it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator
							assigns a value to a variable. <span class="blue">var x=10</span>
						<li><span class="underline">Data Types</span> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate
						on variables you need to know the data type. There are six
						data types that are JavaScript primitives:Boolean-<span class="blue">true</span> or
						<span class="blue">false</span> <span class="blue">null</span>-aka nothing;Number-<span class="blue">42</span>
						 or <span class="blue">3.14159</span>; String-
						<span class="blue">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>; <span class="blue">Array-[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo' and Object-</span>
						<span class="blue">[first_name:'Jane',last name:'Doe}'</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="underline">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-hitting different code
						blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.
						There are the following conditional statements: <span class="blue">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="blue">else if</span>
						to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="blue">else</span> we execute this block of code
					</li>
					<li>
					<span class="underline">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing:
						they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times
						then you stop. Thats a loop!
					</li>
					<li><span class="underline">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block.
					Thin of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the
					 instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right
					 way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over
					  and over and over again.
					</ul>
